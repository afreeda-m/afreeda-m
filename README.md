### Hi there! I'm Afreeda 👋

I just graduated from Lighthouse Labs Full-stack web development program.

I have a background in Molecular Biology from the University of Guelph.

I love to cook, play sports and spend time with my family. 

I'm currently working on small full-stack projects to get better and more efficient at coding using my newly acquired programming skills 😄
